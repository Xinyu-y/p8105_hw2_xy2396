## Problem 1

**Mr. Trash Wheel data:**

``` r
#read in dataset form Mr. Trash Wheel excel sheet
mr_tw = 
  read_excel("./data/TrashWheel080619.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N406") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% #clean variable names
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% #omit rows without specific dumpster
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, 0)) %>% #round to integer
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)) #convert into integer data type
```

**Precipitation data (2017 - 2018):**

``` r
#read in precipitation of 2017
prep_17 = 
  read_excel("./data/TrashWheel080619.xlsx", sheet = "2017 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = "2017")

#read in precipitation of 2018
prep_18 = 
  read_excel("./data/TrashWheel080619.xlsx", sheet = "2018 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = "2018")

#bind two datasets and convert month to character
prep = 
  bind_rows(prep_17, prep_18) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

The Mr. Trash Wheel (mr\_tw) dataset contains 344 observations and
includes information of the trash collected by each dumpster, such as
weight, volume, and count of each type of trash (e.g. plastic bottles,
cigarette butts, glass bottles, sports balls). The median number of
sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 was 8.

The Precipitation dataset (prep) contains 24 observations and includes
information of the total precipitation in each month across 2017 and
2018. And the total precipitation in 2018 is 70.33 inches.

## Problem 2

**Read in and clean pols-month dataset:**

``` r
pols_month =
  read.csv(file = "./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>% 
  mutate(month = as.numeric(month), month = month.name[month]) %>% 
  mutate(president = case_when(prez_dem == 1 ~ "dem",
                               prez_gop == 1 ~ "gop",
                               prez_gop == 2 ~ "gop")) %>% 
  select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day)
```

**Read in and clean snp dataset:**

``` r
snp =
  read.csv(file = "./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") %>% 
  mutate(month = as.numeric(month), month = month.name[month]) %>% 
  select(year, month, close)
```

**Read in and clean unemployment dataset:**

``` r
unemploy =
  read.csv(file = "./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  pivot_longer(Jan:Dec, names_to = "month", values_to = "percent") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(month = match(month, month.abb), month = month.name[month], year = as.character(year))
```

**Merge datasets**

``` r
p2_all =
  left_join(pols_month, snp, by = c("year", "month"))
p2_all =
  left_join(p2_all, unemploy, by = c("year", "month"))
```

The ‘pols\_month’ dataset contains 822 observations and variables
indicating the number of governors, senators, and representatives that
are democratic or republican at each month between 1947 to 2015.

The ‘snp’ dataset contains 787 observations and a variable indicating
the closing value of Standard & Poor’s stock market index (S\&P) in each
month between 1950 to 2015.

The ‘unemploy’ dataset contains 816 observations and variable indicating
the percentage of unemployment in each month between 1948 and 2015.

The resulting dataset combining the above three contains 822
observations and 11 variables. The data range from 1947 to 2015, with
some missing values of the stock index (before 1949) and unemployment
rate (before 1948). Some key variables are: “president” – indicating
whether the president is democratic or republican; “close” – indicating
closing value of S\&P index; and “percent” — indicating percentage of
unemployment.

## Problem 3

**Load the dataset**

``` r
baby_name =
  read.csv(file = "./data/Popular_Baby_Names.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  rename(name = child_s_first_name) %>% 
  mutate(name = tolower(name), name = str_to_title(name)) %>% 
  mutate(ethnicity = as.character(ethnicity), ethnicity = str_replace(ethnicity, "BLACK NON HISPANIC", "BLACK NON HISP"), ethnicity = str_replace(ethnicity, "WHITE NON HISPANIC", "WHITE NON HISP"), ethnicity = str_replace(ethnicity, "ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER", "ASIAN AND PACI")) 
```

**Table for name “Olivia”:**

``` r
name_olivia =
  baby_name %>% 
  filter(name == "Olivia", gender == "FEMALE") %>%
  select(-count, -gender, -name) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "year_of_birth",
    values_from = "rank"
  ) 

knitr::kable(name_olivia)
```

| ethnicity      | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | 2013 | 2012 | 2011 |
| :------------- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ASIAN AND PACI |    1 |    1 |    1 |    3 |    3 |    4 |
| BLACK NON HISP |    8 |    4 |    8 |    6 |    8 |   10 |
| HISPANIC       |   13 |   16 |   16 |   22 |   22 |   18 |
| WHITE NON HISP |    1 |    1 |    1 |    1 |    4 |    2 |

We can see that the girl’s name Olivia is pretty popular across years
among Non-Hispanic White, and Asian/Pacific Islander population; while
it is less popular among Non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic population.

**Table for most popular boy’s name over years:**

``` r
name_boy = 
  baby_name %>% 
  filter(rank == 1, gender == "MALE") %>% 
  select(-count, -gender, -rank) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "year_of_birth",
    values_from = "name"
  ) 

knitr::kable(name_boy)
```

| ethnicity      | 2016   | 2015   | 2014   | 2013   | 2012   | 2011    |
| :------------- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :------ |
| ASIAN AND PACI | Ethan  | Jayden | Jayden | Jayden | Ryan   | Ethan   |
| BLACK NON HISP | Noah   | Noah   | Ethan  | Ethan  | Jayden | Jayden  |
| HISPANIC       | Liam   | Liam   | Liam   | Jayden | Jayden | Jayden  |
| WHITE NON HISP | Joseph | David  | Joseph | David  | Joseph | Michael |

It seems that Jayden is a pretty popular boy’s name across different
ethinicity group except in Non-Hispanic White population.

**Scatter plot of number of children of a name vs. popularity of the
name among male, white non-hispanic children born in 2016**

``` r
baby_name %>% 
  filter(gender == "MALE", year_of_birth == 2016, ethnicity == "WHITE NON HISP") %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = rank, y = count)) +
  geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw2_xy2396_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

The number of children with a name is (indeed) negative associated with
the rank of the popularity of that name. Also, for names that rank
between 3-14, the differences in number of children with the two names
adjacent in ranking were relatively larger than that shown in names
ranked after 14.
